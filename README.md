## Oh-My-Zsh
I'm using [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

## Alias
alias.zsh is usually found or created in the oh-my-zsh custom folder if you
``cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom`` then ``touch alias.zsh`` to create it, if it doesn't exist.

## Vim
The package manager being used is [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
