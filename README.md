## Oh-My-Zsh
I'm using [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [Oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

## Alias
alias.zsh is usually found or created in the oh-my-zsh custom folder if you
``cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom`` then ``touch alias.zsh`` to create it, if it doesn't exist.

## Neovim
I made the switch from Vim to [Neovim](https://neovim.io) <br>
Neovim was installed through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) with ``brew install neovim`` <br>
The package manager being used is [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

## Tmux
I have started using tmux. Plugins and settings found in [tmux-config](https://github.com/theronj60/dotconfigs/blob/master/.tmux.conf)
